- title: Validators
  details: Our Secret Network is run by a group of up to 50 node operators, who are equipped with secure enclaves to perform trusted computations without access to the data. They earn rewards by staking, and these validators can get a percentage of staking rewards via delegators.
- title: Developers
  details: If you want to make a better internet, solve for privacy. Our system allows developers to create Secret Apps, which use encrypted or sensitive data without revealing it. With privacy at the core, you can build solutions that really empower users to control their personal information.
- title: Interoperability
  details: We are thrilled to be part of the Cosmos ecosystem, which is focused on scalability, usability and interoperability. The inter-blockchain communication protocol is very interesting, and the plan is to develop a Secret Hub within our universal network of networks.
