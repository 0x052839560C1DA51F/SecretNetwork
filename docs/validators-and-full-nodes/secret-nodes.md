# Validators

It is possible for anyone who holds SCRT to become a Secret Network Validator or Delegator, and thus participate in both staking and governance processes. Currently, no special hardware is required. If and when the network votes to include secret contracts, validators will be required to run nodes with the latest version of Intel SGX. For information on running a validator, joining the network, staking, and voting, please see the walkthrough below and our [governance documentation](/protocol/governance.md). For a partial list of compatible hardware, see [this list](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware) (this guide is not maintained by Enigma or the Secret Network community).
