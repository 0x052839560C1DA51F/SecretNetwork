# Developers

Developers can currently write contracts for the network using CosmWasm. Once secret contracts have been included in the Secret Network, developers will be able to use private data in these contracts. We currently have a [walkthrough for developers](/dev/contract-dev-guide) that demonstrates how to get the Secret Network up and running on a local deployment using Docker, as well as how to write simple contracts in Rust using CosmWasm. The walkthrough also demonstrates how to interact with these contracts and how to write tests for them. In the future, once we have enabled secret contracts with data privacy for the testnet, developers will be able to write secret contracts using this guide.
